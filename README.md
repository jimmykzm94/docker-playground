# Docker Playground

This repository serves as a collection of my personal notes and practical examples for using Docker in various development scenarios. Each numbered directory represents a self-contained example or project.

## Examples

Here are the projects currently in this playground:

- **[1 create first image](./1%20create%20first%20image/)**: A basic "Hello World" in Python, demonstrating a simple Docker build and run.
- **[2 pass argument](./2%20pass%20argument/)**: Shows how to pass command-line arguments to a Python script running in a Docker container.
- **[3 append message](./3%20append%20message/)**: An example of appending a message to a file inside a container, using a volume to persist the data.
- **[5 wine notepads](./5%20wine%20notepads/)**: A more complex example of running a Windows application (Notepad) in container using Wine and XQuartz for the GUI.
- **[6 tflite build](./6%20tflite%20build/)**: A Docker-based environment for building the TensorFlow Lite Micro library for embedded targets like the STM32 NUCLEO-F446RE.

*More examples will be added over time.*
