How to run notepad using docker (tested with Mac only)

Requirements:
1. Install XQuartz
    brew install --cask xquartz

How to use makefile:
1. make create_volume => create volume, do it once
2. make build => build the docker image, this will take a while
3. make before_run => open XQuartz app and set xhost to display notepad screen, update to use other than en0
4. make run => run notepad
5. make remove => remove the docker image
